# csm_quiz_homework_4

## About the Page
This project is currently incomplete. There were complications getting the questions to cycle-through properly, and unltimately, I waited too long to seek guidence on how to work that out.

It it's current state the quiz will start and questions will progress when the correct choice is selected; wrong answers will recieve a time(i.e: score) penalty.

The CSS can be improved (dramatically.) Most of the current effort was spend in javascript functionality...It won't be a very fun quiz if it doesn't look fun.

However, after all questions are answered the quiz does not resolve to the "end" page (the score entry page). Additionally, when the timer runs out to "0" the game does not resolve properly, and only clears the content with an end message.

I would very much like to finish this project, so that it is up to spec and running as intended.
